###Research Background and Interests
In 2014, I graduated from the University of Missouri - Kansas City. At UMKC, my research concerns focused around
Linguistics, Digital Media and Writing. For the last seven years, I have taught English as a Foreign Language both 
at the high school level, where I worked directly under a non-profit organization, and at the university where I 
currently teach Composition to university freshman.  

When teaching at the high schools in rural Hunan province, I was immersed in regional dialects spoken by the _Miao_ and 
_TuJia_ minority groups. That helped me develop my research focus on documenting dialects to help understand the structure
of Sino-Tibetan linguistics.
