# Jon Miller || Educator and Software Engineer

## I make websites. This is a blog where I document new tools and ideas that I use and think about.
When not programming, I ride bikes, and a co-founder of [ `Osmanthus` ](https://osmanthus.press) - an experimental poetry collective that explores the 
intersections between poetry and programming. We will publish poetry chapbooks plus other digital mediums coming
soon. My arrival into the techspace came during a conversation with a fellow traveler in Korea. Before that my
cousins and I would make Angelfire websites. My maturation process will be documented here with the various components, tools, and features that I find interesting.
As I grow as a software engineer, please check back for new and exciting tools.
