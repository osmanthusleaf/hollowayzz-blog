#Learning to Speak

*...I do not think of the brain as 'searching for analogies' so much as having analogies forced upon it by its own
limitations," Alan Turing in a letter to Jack Good (1948)*

that highly recursive, conditional and repetitive routines are used because they are notationally efficient, as
descriptions of underlying processes.

the importance of structure to how logical processes take place is beginning to diminish as the complexity of the 
logical process increases.

Structure can always be replaced by code with humans left to interpret the results.

To pursue the relationship between logic, computability, perhaps machine languages, and the things that you can 
find out scientifically, now that this tool is available.
